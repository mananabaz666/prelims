    <h1>Mark Zuckerberg</h1>
    <p>Founded: Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</p>
    <p>Born: May 14, 1984,
    <a href="plain.html">White Plains</a></p>
    <p>Spouse:
    <a href="chan.html">Priscilla Chan
      </a></p>

      <p>
        <a href="mark.html">Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</a>
        (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American business magnate, internet entrepreneur,
      and philanthropist. He is known for co-founding the social media website Facebook and its parent company Meta
      Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is the chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling
      shareholder. Zuckerberg attended
      <a href="harvard.html">Harvard University,
        </a>
  where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates
  <a href="ed.html">Eduardo Saverin,</a>
   <a href="an.html">Andrew McCollum,</a>
   <a href="dus.html">Dustin Moskovitz,</a>

     and
     Chris Hughes.
     Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually
     beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority
      shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire.  As of September 2022,
      Zuckerberg's net worth was $52.8 billion according to the Forbes' Real Time Billionaires.</p>

<h2>Software development</h2>
<p>Early years</p>
<p>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that
  allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.
  [16][17] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the
  <a href="synapse.html">Synapse Media Player.</a>
   The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to
   <a href="slash.html">Slashdot</a>
   [18] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[19] A New Yorker profile said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them."</p>

<p>College years</p>
<p>The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to
   <a href="aep.html">Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>
   and
  <a href="kirk.html">Kirkland House.</a>
    [4][11][20] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos.
   Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:<p>

<p>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms.
  At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had
  to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.

The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had
overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition,
many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and
the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper".</p>

<ul><h2>Facebook</h2>
<li>Main articles: Facebook and History of Facebook
The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[23] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[24][25][26] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[25]
</li><li>
Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[27] The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response. While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story,[28] Zuckerberg broke into two of the editors' email accounts. He did it based on the editors' private login data logs from TheFacebook.[29][30]

<ul><h2>Controversies and lawsuits</h2>
  <li>
    ConnectU lawsuits<br/>
Main article: ConnectU
Harvard students
<a href="cam.html">Cameron Winklevoss,</a>
<a href="ty.html">Tyler Winklevoss, </a>
and
 <a href="div.html">Divya Narendra</a>
  accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[73] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[74]

In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed; the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[75]

    Eduardo Saverin<br/>
Main article: Eduardo Saverin
In 2005, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook, alleging that Zuckerberg had illegally spent Saverin's money on personal expenses. The lawsuit was settled out of court, though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook, and Saverin agreed to stop talking to the press.[76][77]

    Pakistan criminal investigation<br/>
In June 2010, Pakistani
<a href="dep.html">Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque</a>
 launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders
 <a href="dus.html">Dustin Moskovitz</a>
  and
 <a href="chris.html">Chris Hughes</a>
  after a "Draw Muhammad" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[78][79]

    Paul Ceglia<br/>
Main article:
<a href="paul.html">Paul Ceglia</a>
In June 2010,
<a href="paul.html">Paul Ceglia</a>
 the owner of a
 <a href="chris.html">wood pellet fuel company</a>
  in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">facebook.com<a>
   until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[80][81]

On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars." Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[82] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[83][84]

    Hawaiian land ownership<br/>
In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight "quiet title and partition" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land which they own. This land is contained within the 700 acres of land in the Hawaiian island of Kauai that Zuckerberg had purchased in 2014. University of Hawaii law professor Kapua Sproat stated that Zuckerberg's lawsuits was "the face of neocolonialism".[85] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their "fair share".[85] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.[86][87]
